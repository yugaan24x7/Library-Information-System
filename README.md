# Library-Information-System
This Library Information System is a lightweight desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It provides two distinct interfaces â€” one for administrators (librarians) and another for general users (students/faculty). The system enables seamless management of books, issuance, returns, fine tracking, membership renewal, and more.
